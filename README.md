Fruit detection and classification using machine learning involves identifying and categorizing fruits in images. This process has applications in agriculture, retail, and quality control. The first step is preparing a dataset, which includes collecting images of various fruits under different conditions and annotating them with labels for detection (bounding boxes) and classification. Data augmentation techniques, such as flipping, rotation, and color adjustments, are applied to enhance model performance. For detection, models like Faster R-CNN, depending on the trade-off between accuracy and speed. For classification, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as MobileNet are preferred. The trained model can then be deployed to identify and classify fruits in real-world application, providing efficient and automated solutions.
